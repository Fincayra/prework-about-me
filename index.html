      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hi, my name is Jay and I'm just your typical Colorado native learning to code. What's not typical about me is the fact that I am currently battling brain cancer, but that's not going to stop me from achieveing my goals.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I was born in Northern California, but I moved here when I was only 4 years old. I've been living in Colorado for 24 years and it's all I've ever known.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Writing, coding, gaming, drawing, and traveling.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I'd like to be a web developer working remotely so I can devote most of my life to traveling and spending time with loved ones.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Lafayette, Colorado.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>Coding is something I've been doing for fun since I was just a kid. I love every part of it- troubleshooting, skipping meals to write lines of css and html, watching the page come to life the way I designed it. It took me too long to realize I could actually be good at this with the right training, and now that I have, I can't imagine a career I'm better suited for. I actually get excited at the thought of learning to code, and that's how I know this is the right path for me.</p>
